<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p><strong>When we started this study, we didn't know where we were heading and what all was going to come our way. All we knew was that we wanted to choose ‘The Right Oil’ for our project. After all, we don't want to serve our customers what we won't consume ourselves and deem unfit for usage.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our product, ‘The Great Indian Kachori’ is a snack that goes long back in the history of rich Indian Tradition and is a deep-fried product. Each Kachori is supposed to swim in hot oil for at least 15 mins until it becomes all puffed up, flaky, crispy, and as we all Indians know, ‘Khasta’.</strong></p>
<p><strong>While it is swimming and dancing around in the hot oil, the Oil is doing its bit of entering the streets of Kachori layers pushing water out and making itself a resident of the vessels that run around on the exterior of the Kachori Layer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oil looks transparent but lots are happening inside this hot liquid which we don't see with naked eyes. We need science and analysis to understand how Oil behaves during deep-frying and once it enters our body how it contributes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This study is aimed at finding out which oil we are going to use and to make this study available for our consumers and enthusiasts in this field to educate themselves and evaluate.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>We at Old School Foods strive to serve our customers, food that is well researched, developed and that we deem fit to consume and hence find joy in taking up challenging tasks like this study or going the ‘No-maida (refined flour)’ approach or basing our entire operations on using jaggery instead of processed sugar.</p>
<p>‘The Right Oil Study’ is one of our first such projects and we wish to contribute to society by adopting the best practices for all our basket brands with Kachori Kaka being the first one and more to come.</p>
<p>Hope you find the study insightful and that it helps you in making the best choices for your family :)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>The Start</h1>
<p>Usually, when we have to clean a mess, we have to make our feet dirty. That's precisely what we are going to do. The only difference is that we don’t know how much there is to find but let's dive right in.</p>
<p>One would be amazed to find out, there are so many oils out there in the market and each oil is deemed the best, the healthiest, and the safest. While this is a statement that we hear quite often but it can't be true. So let’s start by picking up the most popular Oils that we hear about in the market.</p>

<p>After reading up a bit, we gather some information on how these oils should be compared. Below are important factors, we shall be considering:</p>
<div>
<h2>A. Fatty Acid Composition</h2>
<p>Each oil comes from a different source. In the case of vegetable oils, it comes from different fruits, seeds, nuts, etc. In the case of animal oils (in our case, ghee) it might be coming from dairy products having fats of their own.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unsaturated Fatty Acids</p>
<ol>
<li>Monounsaturated Fatty Acid (MUFA)</li>
<li>Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saturated Fatty Acids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trans Fatty Acids</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Free Fatty Acids</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div>
<h2>B. Smoke Point</h2>
<p>Smoke point is the temperature at which oil starts burning and degrades itself. Oil continuously heated at temperatures above smoke point is not safe to consume and may also lead to the development of carcinogenic elements. <br>
This also considers suitability at deep-frying. Some oils because of their intrinsic properties are more stable when deep-frying either because of chemical composition or the presence of antioxidants.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>C. Health benefits and side-effects</h2>
<p>Since each oil is coming from a different source, it also packs unique inherent properties which have their own benefits as well as side effects (probably on over-consumption)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>D. Vitamin composition</h2>
<p>Each source of Oils also contains different levels of Vitamins. Vitamin E and Vitamin K are vitamins that are mostly found in oils but their quantity might be different.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>E. Cholesterol levels and calories</h2>
<p>Most of the oils provide similar energy on consumption (calorific value). While we talk about cholesterol, there are two types of cholesterol: HDL and LDL, the former regarded as the good one.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>F. Unrefined or refined</h2>
<p>Oil is extracted from the base (fruits, nuts, seeds, dairy) in multiple ways. These processes could produce unrefined or refined oil.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>G. Physical attributes of the oil</h2>
<p>The oil has multiple physical characteristics like color, flavor, aroma, stickiness, etc. We use this comparison factor for oil since this is the first impression of the oil.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>H. Reusability of the Oil</h2>
<p>While it's no surprise that the oil is reused in households and even in commercial setups. One has to be smart about how to select the oil that has a higher reusability factor as well as how to enhance the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Acknowledgment</h1>
<p>Before we get any further, Old School Foods would like to acknowledge the efforts put in by Ms. Narmada Rage and Mr. Alex Bernard for their keen understanding of the need to do this study. The study was not easy and Narmada had to read at least 50 research papers, several articles to find all the details about each oil. Alex acted as a strong mentor to Narmada and helped her structure all the information that she collaborated and quantify data to create a mathematical model to determine the best oil for our use case.</p>
<p>We hope that the study is also insightful to domestic households and other commercial setups and that it helps them choose the right oil for their usage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>What is Edible Oil ?</h1>
<p>Edible oil is a fatty liquid that is physically extracted from several vegetable sources like fruits, nuts, seeds, etc, or animal tissues. These act as a source of energy for the vegetables and when extracted can be used for cooking purposes like deep-frying, baking, and other types of cooking.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Is Oil Bad for Health ?</h1>
<p>There is no easy answer to this. Remember an old proverb that says, “Excess of everything is bad”. Most of us regard Olive Oil as the best Oil which we are going to take up separately. Even Olive Oil in <a href="https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/unexpected-side-effects-of-olive-oil/">excess consumption</a> can lead to blockage of the gallbladder leading to gallstones and causing mild diarrhea.</p>
<p>What the study is trying to find out is which Oil does the least amount of damage and is also beneficial in moderate quantities.</p>
<p>The study in no way is trying to promote heavy usage of edible oils in daily diets and is trying to be an eye-opener to several categories of edible oils and how to choose the right one for individual usage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1>Comparison Frames</h1>
<p>In this section, we try to understand the comparison parameters individually and bring out the best in each.</p>
<div>
<h2>A. Fatty Acid Composition</h2>
<p>Dietary fat despite having a bad reputation is vital for health since the body requires fat for energy and absorption of certain vitamins and minerals and many other critical processes.</p>
<h4>1. Unsaturated Fatty Acids</h4>
<p>Unsaturated fatty acid is one in which there is one or more double bond in the fatty acid chain</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Monounsaturated Fatty Acid (MUFA)</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>One double bond</li>
<li>MUFA may help lower LDL (bad cholesterol) and maintain a high level of HDL (good cholesterol)</li>
<li>It may help lower the risk for cardiovascular disease and overall mortality</li>
<li>Anti-inflammatory properties</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA)</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>More than one double bond</li>
<li>May lower LDL cholesterol</li>
<li>Helps with muscle movement and blood clotting</li>
<li>Since the human body doesn’t make PUFA, one has to get it through dietary intake</li>
<li>Omega-3s are important for the fetal development of the brain</li>
<li>Omega-6s support the cardiovascular, immune, and reproductive system</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
The greater the degree of unsaturation, in fatty acid (ie more double bonds), the more it is vulnerable to rancidity (ie oxidation of oils resulting in a bad taste and smell).</p>
<p>When double bonds are formed, hydrogen atoms are eliminated.</p>
<h4>2. Saturated Fatty Acids</h4>
<p>Saturated fat is &quot;saturated&quot; with hydrogen atoms and contains no double bonds. SFA is solid at room temperature and hence also called “solid fat”. Research studies often suggest the impact of saturated fat on heart health, leaving this confusing for consumers. SFA raises LDL (bad cholesterol) levels and certain other heart disease risk factors, such as inflammation. Though it is not clear if it certainly poses risk for heart diseases. Since SFA doesn't have any double bonds, it is the most stable at high temperatures and doesn't break down easily.</p>
<h4>3. Trans Fatty Acids</h4>
<p>This fatty acid is changed by a process called hydrogenation. This process aims to increase the shelf life of the fat making it harder at room temperature thus making crispier and flakier crusts. TFA can raise cholesterol levels and hence is advised to be consumed as little as possible. These can be found in processed foods, snack foods, such as chips and crackers, cookies, etc. TFA adds no nutritional value to the diet and may also harm health.</p>
<h4>4. Free Fatty Acids</h4>
<p>Free Fatty acids (FFA) are produced by the hydrolysis of oils and fats. Since FFA are less stable than neutral oil, they are more prone to oxidation and to turning rancid.</p>
<p>One should try to consume more unsaturated fat instead of saturated fat and trans fat which may help improve cholesterol levels. The <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10981129_Dietary_fat_and_heart_health_in_search_of_the_ideal_fat">proportion</a> of MUFA:PUFA:SFA for maintaining the ideal ratio of HDL/LDL is <strong>40:30:30</strong>. The below table contains our ranking for the selected oils.</p>

<p>From the above ranking, one might be surprised to see the likes of coconut, sunflower, olive, avocado oil, and ghee not making it to the top. However, it's been <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10981129_Dietary_fat_and_heart_health_in_search_of_the_ideal_fat">established</a> that a high-mono diet inferior to a diet with a balanced MUFA:PUFA:SFA ratio.</p>

<h2>B. Smoke Point</h2>
<p>When we talk about smoke point, there are few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smoke point of the refined oil</li>
<li>Smoke point of the unrefined oil</li>
<li>Threshold of Oil temperature</li>
</ul>
<p>Before we move further, it is important to understand the difference between unrefined and refined oil.</p>

<p>For our usage of deep-frying, we are not supposed to exceed 180*C and have to choose an oil that has a smoke point above this temperature. This also helps us reuse the oil conservatively and more safely since oil that reaches smoke point is deemed unfit for reuse.</p>
<p>Further, let's get into the smoke points of different oils and find which one matches our requirements.</p>

<h2>C. Health benefits and side-effects</h2>
<p>Each oil as mentioned earlier comes from a different source that could be a nut, seed, vegetable, or dairy. Inherent to the source, each oil will have different components and will impact the consumers’ health in different ways.</p>
<p>The study will not be able to highlight all the positive and negative impacts here as it is a comprehensive list, but let's try to cover up major points which will help us become more aware consumers.</p>
<h3>Avocado Oil</h3>

<h2>Reusability of the Oil</h2>
<p>Reusability of oil is a topic where one feels like reusing the oil without understanding the fundamentals behind its suitability to be reused.</p>
<p><strong>1. What happens when you use fresh oil?</strong></p>
<p>The oil has natural components which get heated along with the oil during cooking. These components may add additional flavor, the aroma when heated.</p>
<p><strong>2. What happens when you heat oil at the smoke point?</strong></p>
<p>Smoke point is essentially the temperature at which the oil (or the components) start burning.</p>
<p>Like any other substance, when these components are heated to a high temperature (say smoke point or above), they may burn, leaving them unsuitable for consumption.</p>
<p>Heating at smoke point (or above) oxidizes oil, creates free radicals, and also causes the unpleasant odors and flavor that is associated with rancidity.</p>
<p><strong>3. What are free radicals and are they harmful?</strong></p>
<p>While cooking, these components get oxidized and generate free radicals which contribute to the etiology of many chronic health problems such as cardiovascular and inflammatory disease, cataracts, and cancer.</p>
<p><strong>4. What role do Natural(or synthetic) antioxidants play?</strong></p>
<p>Antioxidants prevent the oxidation of oil and hence the generation of free radicals. They also reduce induced tissue damage by preventing the formation of radicals, scavenging them, or by promoting their decomposition.</p>
<p>Some oils have naturally abundant oxidants like avocado, groundnut, olive, sunflower, etc. Also, there are some naturally occurring antioxidants coming from phytochemicals that inhibit oxidation if added to the oil. Then, there are some synthetic antioxidants like BHT, BHA, TBHQ, and propyl gallate which are added in oils while deep-frying to artificially inhibit oxidation while cooking. Synthetic oils may have certain side effects.</p>
<p>As part of traditional methods, in some parts of India, adding alum to the oil is a common practice while deep-frying. As a surprise, alum is a mild anti-oxidant.</p>
<p><strong>5. How is the reusability of the oil decided?</strong></p>
<p>Now that it is clear what makes oil unusable for reuse, we are in a better position to decide how to evaluate the oil on its reusability factor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of the oils can be reused once</li>
<li>Certain oils which have the presence of antioxidants in their composition can be reused twice</li>
<li>Olive oil has an abundance of natural antioxidants that can be reused thrice</li>
<li>Oils not touching the smoke point in their usage are more reusable than oils heated to smoke point. Hence, it is advisable to select the oil which has a high smoke point which delays the burning process and generation of free-radicals</li>
<li>Once the oil starts generating foam while using, it is past its point of reuse</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>6. What to do with the used oil?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Once the oil starts generating foam while using, it is past its point of reuse</li>
<li>The oil that was deemed unfit for high heating can be used for low-heating purposes like shallow frying or tossing, etc.</li>
<li>The oil that is unfit for any consumption at all should be properly discarded.</li>
<li>Biodiesel can be generated from waste edible oils and can be sourced to the appropriate vendors. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FcDsiTJSMs">Video for reference</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>With this study, we have surely educated ourselves and also made an effort to raise awareness for our consumers. Choose your oil carefully and be wary of what you are consuming.</p>
<p>French lawyer, Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, in 1826 wrote,
<em><strong>&quot;Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es.&quot;</strong></em>
<strong>Translation:</strong> Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are</p>
