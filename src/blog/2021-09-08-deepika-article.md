# Introduction

We at Old School Foods strive to serve our customers, food that is well researched, developed and that we deem fit to consume and hence find joy in taking up challenging tasks like this study or going the ‘No-maida (refined flour)’ approach or basing our entire operations on using jaggery instead of processed sugar.

‘The Right Oil Study’ is one of our first such projects and we wish to contribute to society by adopting the best practices for all our basket brands with Kachori Kaka being the first one and more to come.



Hope you find the study insightful and that it helps you in making the best choices for your family :)

# The Start

Usually, when we have to clean a mess, we have to make our feet dirty. That's precisely what we are going to do. The only difference is that we don’t know how much there is to find but let's dive right in.



One would be amazed to find out, there are so many oils out there in the market and each oil is deemed the best, the healthiest, and the safest. While this is a statement that we hear quite often but it can't be true. So let’s start by picking up the most popular Oils that we hear about in the market.



|               |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Avocado Oil   | Canola Oil    |
| Palm Oil      | Pistachio Oil |
| Coconut Oil   | Ghee          |
| Rice bran Oil | Safflower Oil |
| Groundnut Oil | Mustard Oil   |
| Sesame Oil    | Soybean Oil   |
| Olive Oil     | Sunflower Oil |

At this point, we don't know much about oils. We are not even sure about what factors we are going to consider to compare them, so the only option we have right now is to read up on these oils and why they are used where they are used and learn what all factors play an important role in deciding the suitability of the Oil.



After reading up a bit, we gather some information on how these oils should be compared. Below are important factors, we shall be considering:

## Fatty Acid Composition

\
Each oil comes from a different source. In the case of vegetable oils, it comes from different fruits, seeds, nuts, etc. In the case of animal oils (in our case, ghee) it might be coming from dairy products having fats of their own.

1. Unsaturated Fatty Acids
2. 1. Monounsaturated Fatty Acid (MUFA)
   2. Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid (PUFA)
3. Saturated Fatty Acids
4. Trans Fatty Acids
5. Free Fatty Acids

</div>

2. Smoke Point\
   Smoke point is the temperature at which oil starts burning and degrades itself. Oil continuously heated at temperatures above smoke point is not safe to consume and may also lead to the development of carcinogenic elements.

This also considers suitability at deep-frying. Some oils because of their intrinsic properties are more stable when deep-frying either because of chemical composition or the presence of antioxidants.
