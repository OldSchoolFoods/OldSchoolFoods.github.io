# Introduction

Covid-19 caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is  still continuing as global pandemic regardless of various detection strategies and drugs  recommended for its effective treatment. As of 25th April 2021, the Worldometer confirms  147,182,092 cases of COVID-19 prevailing worldwide. Out of which, nearly 17 million infected  people are from India (1).

# Effect of Pandemic

The pandemic deteriorates the nutritional status of an infected person by inducing nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea and low appetite. Thus, malnutrition is commonly observed complication in  Covid patients. This may result in muscle wasting as well as weakness in the body which was  observed in 50% of the infected patients as stated by Dr. Riccardo Caccialanza from his  research(2). He further noticed immunodeficiency that made them more vulnerable to other  infections and prolonged their recovery time. 

# Role of Nutrition in Covid-Manangement

Nutrition has a provable role in prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Protein is a vital  macronutrient that helps in strengthening the immune system, preventing muscle wasting,  making up of lean tissue loss, reducing the risk of complications and fastening the recovery time. Many evidences show that dietary supplementation of specific amino acids like Arginine,  Glutamine and Cysteine boost the immune system which reduces morbidity and mortality rate (3). 

Fernández-Quintela (2020) demonstrated in his research paper that protein have significant  effects on the rate of recovery from covid-19 infection. Intake of protein rich foods like egg, fish,  meat, milk, lentils, tofu, paneer, soya milk, beans, etc have been found to increase protein levels  in infected patients. This helps in huge antibody production that reduces the risk of infections (4). 

**More than 1g/kg body wt of protein is strictly recommended by ESPEN guidelines (5) for  polymorbid COVID patients to avoid loss of body weight,**lessen the severity of infection and  strengthen the respiratory muscles. But the quantity of protein should be adjusted in case of  chronic renal disorder (6). 

More protein is required for older adults in comparison to young and middle aged individuals  due to lower immune response and increased level of inflammatory mediators in their blood (7). ESPEN guidelines has suggested at 1g/kg body wt of protein to retain muscle mass .The amount  of required protein can be increased upto 2g/kg body wt in case of severe muscle wasting (5). 

A Funagata study (9) shows 2.3 times lower risk of catching common cold and influenza virus  infection on regular consumption of yogurt . There was also an increment in the natural killer  cell activity. Possibility of lowering the inflammation caused by COVID infection was also

found in a study when a protein diet having high biological value from dietary sources like eggs,  fish, lean meat, and non-fat dairy protein like whey protein was taken together (10). 

The infected patients must be encouraged to take high protein diet on a daily basis to supply the  body with sufficient essential amino acids. This helps in regulating the immune system. A study  shows the use of essential amino acids like Arginine and Glutamine for fortifying foods (8). 

ESPEN guidelines also suggest Oral Nutritional supplements for meeting the patients nutritional  needs. Atleast 400 kcal /day including 30g or more of protein per day can be provided by ONS  for a minimum period of 1 month. If nutrional requirement cannot be met orally by polymorbid  and older patients then Enteral mode of Nutrition can be administered. During critical illness  1.4g/kg/body wt protein equivalents per day can be delivered progressively. This target has been  shown to improve survival mainly in frail patients (11). So, high biological value proteins is a must for the COVID infected  patients to speed up their recovery time. 



# Inclusion of other Nutrients

Apart from protein, one must be careful to include other nutrients for their faster recovery and proper rejuvenation of the body.

Table:1 Recommended intakes of certain nutrients with key roles in disease susceptibility and the maintenance of an adequate immune function.

It is well said that, Health is Wealth’ so,  it becomes essential to consume the right kind of diet for a speedy and complete  recovery of the body.
