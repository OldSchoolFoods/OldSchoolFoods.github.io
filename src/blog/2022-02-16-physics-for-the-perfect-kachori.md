# Introduction

Well, it starts with the problem statement of what we want to achieve. 

We want to achieve a Kachori with the following characteristics:

1. Fluffy like a balloon
2. Crisp and flaky like a wafer
3. Golden like a kachori
4. No sharp edges
5. Properly cooked from inside
6. Made with Atta

While it may sound simple to achieve as kachori is a snack that is available in every city of India. But with atta nowhere. The reason is simple, atta is not as elastic as maida.

So how did we get this perfectly shaped kachori? Let's dive right into it.

# Understanding

Why are we publishing this study is because when we started, we had a hard time figuring out the right shape and texture of kachoris with ‘zero maida’ and we hardly found any educational material around what goes behind fluffing a kachori up.

Whenever there is someone again searching for this kind of information we don’t want them to feel helpless like we did.

So, let's start by understanding how this piece of dough with flavourful filling inside it becomes fluffy.

It's the same reason why a balloon becomes inflated. Air trapped inside it.

But, are we inducing air into the kachori as we do in balloons? No ! Then how does it take that shape? It's because of the steam that is generated inside the kachori because of the moisture present in the dough.

Some people would suggest using baking soda/powder for this but it won't do the same job. It will make the layer of the dough puffed up but not necessarily the kachori as a whole.

# Process of making Kachori

1. First, we take a ball of masala and wrap it inside a ball of dough
2. The kachori ball is pressed from top and bottom neatly to make a flattened kachori
3. The flattened kachori is simmered in hot ghee
4. The hot ghee starts moving inside the vessels of kachori dough
5. The moisture in the kachori starts escaping which is seen in the form of bubbles appearing on the surface
6. The moisture in the inner layers of the dough starts evaporating into steam and tries to escape
7. Having no place to escape steam pushes the kachori out and starts inflating it
8. The cooking process continues and the inflated kachori hardens and browns itself

# Constraints

1. It is evident that steam helps inflate the kachori but more moisture does not mean better kachori.

Now that we have an idea of how kachori becomes a good kachori, we can talk about the necessary physics and mathematics that goes to make a well shaped kachori

Masala inside kachori should break itself into two parts one for the top layer and one for the bottom layer

Steam generated at the bottom layer will help the upper layer inflate and when flipped vice versa. So the heavier side (if any, ideally no) should be at bottom first.

The steam generated helps the upper layer rise and when flipped the other layer helps it rise so the heavier side at bottom first so that when it is flipped enough moisture is present in it to give rise

Oil when poured on top generates steam on the top surface which is not exposed to the heated oil. This results in inflation

If the edges are sharp, so will the kachori be after it has risen

Let us come to crafting mini kachoris now. Before we start off with the physics behind it, let us set a foundation by stating that- there's a strong connection between what works for mini kachoris is the exact opposite of what creates a barrier for kachoris.

1. While making a kachori, we need the steam to be trapped inside when frying it so that the kachori can inflate and reach its desired form. and the same steam with mini kachoris bursts With mini kachoris, when the steam is trapped inside it needs a getaway and that's why it bursts out from the mini kachori causing it to break.
2. What we understand by this is that the air inside the mini kachori needs an escape and we need to do something about the same. Therefore, before the mini kachori enters the hot ghee to be fried a few holes are poked into it with a toothpick for the air to pass while frying.
3. This is an important step for making mini kachoris as this is what determines the final form of the mini kachori.
