Well, it starts with the problem statement of what we want to achieve. 

We want to achieve a Kachori with following characteristics:

1. Fluffy like a balloon
2. Crisp and flaky like a wafer
3. Golden like a kachori
4. No sharp edges
5. Properly cooked from inside
6. Made with Atta

While it may sound simple to achieve as kachori is a snack which is available in every city of India. But with atta nowhere. The reason is simple because atta is not as elastic as maida.

So how did we get this perfectly shaped kachori? Let's dive right into it.

Why are we publishing this study is because when we started we felt shortage of good material to help us get through and had we found some material like we are creating we would have found new respect for the creator of that study.

So, let's start by understanding how this piece of dough with flavourful filling inside it becomes fluffy.

It's the same reason why a balloon becomes inflated. Air trapped inside it.

But, are we inducing air into the kachori like we do in balloons ? No ! Then how does it take that shape ? It's because of the steam that is generated inside the kachori because of the moisture present in the dough.

Some people would suggest using baking soda/powder for this but it wont do the same job. It will make the layer of the kachori puffed up but not necessarily the kachori as whole.



## The process of making kachori is as follows:

1. First we take a ball of masala and wrap it inside a ball of dough
2. The kachori ball is pressed from top and bottom neatly to become a flattened kachori
3. The flattened kachori is simmered in hot oil
4. The hot oil starts moving inside the vessels of kachori dough
5. The moisture in the kachori starts escaping which is seen in the form of bubbles appearing on the surface
6. The moisture in the inner layers of the dough starts evaporating into steam and tries to escape
7. Having no place to escape steam pushes the kachori out and starts inflating it
8. The cooking process continues and the inflated kachori hardens and browns itself

## Few constraints in the process:

</div>

1. It is evident that steam helps inflate the kachori but more moisture does not mean better kachori. 
2. 1. A more moist dough becomes difficult to hold shape when wrapping masala and flattening it.
   2. It might also create air pockets allowing the steam to escape while it is getting cooked and hence resulting in a flat kachori
   3. The moisture content in the dough should be sufficient to generate enough steam and enable a good wrapping
3. More Masala might not result in better kachori
4. 1. Masala size larger than desired can result in creating break in the dough again allowing steam to escape and unnecessarily flooding oil inside the kachori
   2. Larger masala size might also stick with itself and the dough not allowing the kachori to inflate because of the glue
5. More heat resulting in more steam will not result in a better kachori
6. 1. The function of heat is to generate steam and cooking kachori
   2. Too much heat will definitely result in faster inflation of kachori but it will also brown it faster resulting in kachori that is cooked from outside but not inside
   3. It might also lead to unnecessary heating of oil resulting in degradation of oil
7. Wet Masala more moisture will not result in a better kachori
8. 1. Wet masala will be difficult to be wrapped resulting in breaks in the dough again allowing steam to escape and flooding inside of the kachori with oil
   2. Wet Masala will also make the layer of the kachori from inside moist resulting in a kachori lacking crispiness
9. Improper sealing of the masala inside dough will result in poor kachori
10. 1. Sealing if not done evenly will result in uneven layers probably thicker layer on one side which could also be left uncooked

       1. Improper sealing might result in breaks on the dough breaks in the dough again allowing steam to escape and flooding inside of the kachori with oil
       2. Uneven sealing might leave non-uniform texture on the kachori

Now that we have an idea of how kachori becomes a good kachori, we can talk about the necessary physics and mathematics that goes to make a well shaped kachori

Masala inside kachori should break itself into two parts one for the top layer and one for the bottom layer

Steam generated at the bottom layer will help the upper layer inflate and when flipped vice versa. So the heavier side (if any, ideally no) should be at bottom first.

The steam generated helps the upper layer rise and when flipped the other layer helps it rise so the heavier side at bottom first so that when it is flipped enough moisture is present in it to give rise

Oil when poured on top generates steam on the top surface which is not exposed to the heated oil. This results in inflation

If the edges are sharp, so will the kachori be after it has risen

Let us come to crafting mini kachoris now. Before we start off with the physics behind it, let us set a foundation by stating that- there's a strong connection between what works for mini kachoris is the exact opposite of what works for kachoris.

1. While making a kachori, we need the air to be trapped inside when frying it so that the kachori can inflate and reach its desired form. With mini kachoris, when the air is trapped inside company 3
