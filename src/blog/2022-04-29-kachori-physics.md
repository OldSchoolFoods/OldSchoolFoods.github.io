Well, it starts with the problem statement of what we want to achieve.Â 



We want to achieve a Kachori with following characteristics:

1. Fluffy like a balloon
2. Crisp and flaky like a wafer
3. Golden like a kachori
4. No sharp edges
5. Properly cooked from inside
6. Made with Atta



While it may sound simple to achieve as kachori is a snack which is available in every city of India. But with atta nowhere. The reason is simple because atta is not as elastic as maida.



So how did we get this perfectly shaped kachori? Let's dive right into it.
